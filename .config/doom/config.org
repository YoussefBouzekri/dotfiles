* TODO Introduction
* Rudimentary Configuration
first off, let's make the output file run a tiny bit faster
#+begin_src elisp
;;; config.el -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-
#+end_src
** Personal Information
It is useful to have some basic information, apparently this is used by magit, gpg and such
#+begin_src elisp
(setq user-full-name "spcbfr"
      user-mail-address "spcbfr@protonmail.com")
#+end_src
** Window title
I’d like to have just the buffer name, then if applicable the project folder
#+begin_src elisp
(setq frame-title-format
      '(""
        (:eval
         (if (s-contains-p org-roam-directory (or buffer-file-name ""))
             (replace-regexp-in-string
              ".*/[0-9]*-?" "☰ "
              (subst-char-in-string ?_ ?  buffer-file-name))
           "%b"))
        (:eval
         (let ((project-name (projectile-project-name)))
           (unless (string= "-" project-name)
             (format (if (buffer-modified-p)  " ◉ %s" "  ●  %s") project-name))))))
#+end_src
For example when I open my config file it the window will be titled ~config.org ● doom~ then as soon as I make a change it will become ~config.org ◉ doom~
* Doom Configuration
** Visual Settings
*** Font Face
I am always expermienting with new fonts, so expect this to change very often
#+begin_src elisp
(setq doom-font (font-spec :family "IBM Plex Mono" :size 13) ;; the default general doom font
      doom-unicode-font (font-spec :family "Fira Code" :size 13) ;; Fallback unicode font for icons, glyphs, etc...
      doom-variable-pitch-font (font-spec :family "IBM Plex Mono" :size 15) ;; the font to use for variable-pitch text
      doom-big-font (font-spec :family "Jetbrains Mono" :size 24)) ;; font used in big-font-mode

#+end_src

I like how italics look so I use them for comments, keywords and other things across my system
#+begin_src elisp
(custom-set-faces!
  '(font-lock-comment-face :slant italic)
  '(font-lock-keyword-face :slant italic))
#+end_src
*** Dashboard
since the dashboard is its own major-mode, long key cords for quick commands are unnecessary, let's make them simpler
#+begin_src elisp
(map! :map +doom-dashboard-mode-map
      :ne "f" #'find-file
      :ne "r" #'consult-recent-file
      :ne "p" #'doom/open-private-config
      :ne "v" #'vterm/here
      :ne "c" (cmd! (find-file (expand-file-name "config.org" doom-private-dir)))
      :ne "q" #'save-buffers-kill-terminal)
#+end_src
after using doom for a while, the dashboard "useful commands" are no longer useful. we can remove them for a particularly /clean/ and minimal look
#+begin_src elisp
(remove-hook '+doom-dashboard-functions #'doom-dashboard-widget-shortmenu)
#+end_src
* Packages
