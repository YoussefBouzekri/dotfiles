* STRT Rudimentary Configuration
** Personal Information
It is useful to have some basic information, apparently this is used by magit, gpg and such
#+begin_src elisp
(setq user-full-name "spcbfr"
      user-mail-address "spcbfr@protonmail.com")
#+end_src
** Window title
I’d like to have just the buffer name, then if applicable the project folder
#+begin_src elisp
(setq frame-title-format
      '(""
        (:eval
         (if (s-contains-p org-roam-directory (or buffer-file-name ""))
             (replace-regexp-in-string
              ".*/[0-9]*-?" "☰ "
              (subst-char-in-string ?_ ?  buffer-file-name))
           "%b"))
        (:eval
         (let ((project-name (projectile-project-name)))
           (unless (string= "-" project-name)
             (format (if (buffer-modified-p)  " ◉ %s" "  ●  %s") project-name))))))
#+end_src
For example when I open my config file it the window will be titled ~config.org ● doom~ then as soon as I make a change it will become ~config.org ◉ doom~
